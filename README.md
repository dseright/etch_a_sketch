Etch a Sketch for the The Odin Project jQuery project.

As is right now it's functional. It completes the requirements.

I'm very dissatisfied with the way the darken mode works. It feels hacky and I know there is a better way to do it. But after looking at another solution that I liked I realized I'd like to get further along in my studies before I come back to this and fix the things I don't like. Made me realize how awful my code looks in general. But...it's a good place to start.
